libvmod-throttle (4-0.2) precise; urgency=low

  * Fix not purging entries when their time is exactly one period earlier
  * Several new unit tests to cover the above bug
  * Several new interface functions with the main focus being on testing
  * now is based on the request time, not the current time (this might result
    in entries being out of order, but it should be okay...?)

  * _vmod_remove_older_entries could free calls that were still referenced in
    call windows if the number of calls exceeded the highest window limit.
  * A few places freed the calls structure without freeing the associated
    window list or key fields.
