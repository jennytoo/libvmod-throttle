libvmod-throttle (4-0.1) precise; urgency=low

  * Added AN after all allocs.
  * _vmod_remove_older_entries could free calls that were still referenced in
    call windows if the number of calls exceeded the highest window limit.
  * A few places freed the calls structure without freeing the associated
    window list or key fields.
